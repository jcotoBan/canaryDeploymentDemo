Just a simple canary deployment for beginners like me :) 

Deployment strategies on kubernetes – Canary

The main idea behind canary strategy is to deploy new software only to a small subset of users and then increase this percentage of users.

It provides the following advantages:

→ It is less risky since new features are rolled out only to a small percentage of users.

→ It lets you keep the pace with new feature adoption and receive timely feedback without disruption of the production current release.

→ It only requires one production environment, which makes it cheaper than other strategies like blue/green for example.
